# Accidents-Analysis

This road accident analysis project explores various factors influencing accident severity, including the impact of location (urban vs. rural), lighting conditions (dark vs. light), weather conditions, and vehicle types. By analyzing casualty data, the project identifies key trends and patterns that help understand the relationship between these factors and accident outcomes. The insights aim to support safety initiatives, improve road safety strategies, and inform policy decisions to reduce accidents and fatalities across different environments and conditions.
